        <div class="subheading mb-5">UCR Pre-Business StudentðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Emily Morales-Guzman and I was born and raised in Los Angeles. I grew up in a hispanic household and grew up with many different traditions. This helped me be more aware of different cultures and different traditions that go on around the world. Because of my parents being hispanic, I also grew up learning spanish. I am able to speak English and Spanish which I consider to be an advantage. I consider myself to be an extrovert. I like to meet new people and make new friends. In high school, I would always try to be involved in different things, I even joined our schoolâ€™s student government. Working and collaborating with others was so easy for me to do. I gained more leadership experiences and more social skills. By my senior year of high school, I ended up being class president. I was incharge of many tasks and it helped me learn how to manage my time as well as let others help.  <br><br>

        I am currently a student at the University of California, Riverside. I am majoring in Pre-Business and I am planning to focus on either business administration or marketing. I am a second year student at UCR and I enjoy it there. I have gotten to know many people and have made new friends. Classes at UCR have truly helped me learn more about different things that I may have not known about. I have also been able to learn more in depth about some things that I have already learned about. Like I have said previously, I am currently focusing on getting my bachelors degree for either business administration or marketing. I also want to be able to get an internship so I would be able to get more experience on what I want to do in the future. In the future I hope to see myself continuing my education and getting my masters degree as well.<br><br>
        
        Since I am still a full time student, I hope to continue focusing on my education and getting my bachelors degree. As time goes on, I also would like to be more involved in different clubs and organizations so I can gain more experience. I want to get my degree but also find ways to find different skills I could be good at and try new things to figure out what I will be good at. This will help me decide what I want to do as a career and I will be more set. I will be able to focus on my path and gain more experience and learn more skills so I will be prepared for future internships and job opportunities.
